            <p class="page">ReIReSearch addresses the growing need of scholars in religious studies to discover more data, regardless of location with a platform where disparate digital resources and databases are searchable in a unified and standardized way.</p>
            <p class="page">ReIReSearch is being developed as part of the <a href="https://www.reires.eu" target="_blank">ReIReS</a> project. With this early release, we also want to gather feedback from the community. If you have suggestions or questions, feel free to contact us via <a href="mailto:reires.helpdesk@libis.be">reires.helpdesk@libis.be</a>.</p>
            <p class="page">Certain functionalities require you to create a free account. You can find more information on registering a free account on the <a href="/page/help">Help</a> page.</p>

            <p class="page subtitle1">What can you find on ReIReSearch?</p>
            <p class="page">The data is provided by partner institutions of ReIReS. They house their own collections of manuscripts, documents, and rare books and represent relevant collections of Christian, Jewish and Muslim works. This is complemented by information from specialised subscription databases like the Index Religiosus bibliography. All of them are searchable simultaneously. </p>
            <p class="page">Detailed information on available collections can be found on the <a href="/page/about">About</a> page. For more information on how to use the platform, consult the <a href="/page/help">Help</a> pages.</p>
